## About

Busrides is a product of the CSPS Digital Academy, and a destination created to deepen your understanding of everything digital and government. Itâ€™s where you can get bite-sized learning from leading experts, explore topics you may be curious about, and access the tools to enhance your work...all in the span of a short bus ride. Busrides is in the beta phase of development which means regular site updates are made to enhance your experience!

### About Us

The CSPS Digital Academy was established in 2018 with the aim of teaching Canada's federal public servants the skills, approaches and mindsets they need in today's digital age. This team is passionate about solving problems public servants face in the digital space.

We do this by promoting collaborative learning and providing a platform for peers to share their digital experiences. This team  provides many courses available through the Canada School of Public Service.
