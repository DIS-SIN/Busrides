# Bus Rides Ghost Theme

A custom theme for Bus Rides built off of the [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper/releases) theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/). This is the latest development version of the Bus Rides theme.

## What is Bus Rides?

Busrides is a micro learning platform that focuses on specific Learning Objectives that span 3-6 minutes in length. The platform is an external facing tool that is open to the Canadian Public Service at all levels. Episodes are designed to appeal to multiple learning styles by following a read, watch, listen, apply format;

It will be designed to raise awareness and demystify digital transformation in the GC context. Busrides promotes a collaborative learning culture and encourages learners to share their experiences with peers in an informal manner. Information can be tagged by topic to improve usability.

Bus Rides will also feature easy integration with other interactive applications (Twitter, Medium, Quiz’s)

# First time using a Ghost theme?

Ghost uses a simple templating language called [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) for its themes.

We've documented our default theme pretty heavily so that it should be fairly easy to work out what's going on just by reading the code and the comments. Once you feel comfortable with how everything works, we also have full [theme API documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/api/v2/handlebars-themes/) which explains every possible Handlebars helper and template.

**The main files are:**

- `default.hbs` - The main template file
- `index.hbs` - Used for the home page
- `post.hbs` - Used for individual posts
- `page.hbs` - Used for individual pages
- `tag.hbs` - Used for tag archives
- `author.hbs` - Used for author archives

One really neat trick is that you can also create custom one-off templates just by adding the slug of a page to a template file. For example:

- `page-about.hbs` - Custom template for the `/about/` page
- `tag-news.hbs` - Custom template for `/tag/news/` archive
- `author-ali.hbs` - Custom template for `/author/ali/` archive


# Development

Casper styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.

The `zip` Gulp task packages the theme files into `dist/<theme-name>.zip`, which you can then upload to your site.

```bash
$ yarn zip
```

# PostCSS Features Used

- Autoprefixer - Don't worry about writing browser prefixes of any kind, it's all done automatically with support for the latest 2 major versions of every browser.
- Variables - Simple pure CSS variables
- [Color Function](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-color-function)


# SVG Icons

Casper uses inline SVG icons, included via Handlebars partials. You can find all icons inside `/partials/icons`. To use an icon just include the name of the relevant file, eg. To include the SVG icon in `/partials/icons/rss.hbs` - use `{{> "icons/rss"}}`.

You can add your own SVG icons in the same manner.
