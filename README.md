## 4. Best Practices

### 4.1 Branch Naming Convention

#### Main branches

The main branches have their own names (master and deploy). The legacy Polly branch will likely be deprecated. Those do not require any naming convention.

#### Quick Task Branches

Branches that have a one-time, quick and simple use like update-next, fix-something can be left simple with hyphens

#### Issues and experimentations

If a dev needs to work on an issue or experiment on a feature, it is recommended to identify the issue number, a quick description of the change and if needed, initials such as 110-fix-brokenlinks-sj. That way it is easy to know what is being worked on, to get the documentation from the issue log and who is working on it in case you need to ask questions. Obviously if you plan on not being working on it alone, no need for initials.
